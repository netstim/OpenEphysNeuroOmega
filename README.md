# Open Ephys Neuro Omega

This repository contains a plugin for the [Open Ephys GUI](https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI) to interface with AlphaOmega's [Neuro Omega device](https://www.alphaomega-eng.com/Nero-Omega). 

To build the plugin, the Neuro Omega SDK should already be installed in the computer.
