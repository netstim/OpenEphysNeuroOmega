# Open Ephys Neuro Omega

This repository contains a plugin for the [Open Ephys GUI](https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI) to interface with AlphaOmega's [Neuro Omega device](https://www.alphaomega-eng.com/Nero-Omega). 

## Installation

The Neuro Omega (proprietary) SDK should already be installed in the computer.

The plugin is currently not available in the GUI Plugin installer. The compiled dll for GUI v6 is available from the Releases page. It should be placed under `C:\ProgramData\Open Ephys\plugins-api8`. Also, the `NeuroOmega_x64.dll` from the SDK should be copied to the shared folder: `C:\ProgramData\Open Ephys\shared-api8`.

Alternativly, one can also compile from source. See Open Ephys GUI Documentation for instructions.
To build the plugin, the Neuro Omega SDK should already be installed in the computer.
